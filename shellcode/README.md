# Token Stealing Payload Stub

`shellcode.cpp` contains token stealing payloads for each version of Windows 10 from 1607-2004. 

Adding the `shellcode.h` header file to your C++ source file will allow you to dynamically grab the correct payload for the version of Windows 10 x64 the code is being run on. It can be called by creating an unsigned char array and then calling the `getShellcode()` function with the array variable name as an argument.

```c++
unsigned char payload[62];
getShellcode(payload);
```
